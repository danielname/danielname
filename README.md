My name is Daniel Name <- YES THAT'S MY REAL NAME!

I completed Codeup in San Antonio, TX, in January, 2023 and have been working to improve my code ever since.
I have been successful in learning the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, Java, and SQL, and am currently working on increasing my depth of knowledge in these languages as well as learning Python. Being a former high school math teacher, I am very logically oriented, and I have demonstrated elite problem solving skills.

Given that there are always more shorthands, methods, and properties to learn, I am always looking to find new and more eifficient ways to complete any challenges that I have been presented with.

Thank you for coming to my GitHub page!
