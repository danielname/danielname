My name is Daniel Name <- YES THAT'S MY REAL NAME!

I am currently a student at Codeup in San Antonio, TX, who will be graduating at the end of January, 2023.
I have been successful in learning the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and am currently working on increasing my depth of knowledge in these languages. Being a former high school math teacher, I am very logically oriented, and I have been successful in demonstrating elite problem solving skills.

Given that there are always more shorthands, methods, and properties to learn, I am always looking to find new and more eifficient ways to complete any challenges that I have been presented with.

Thank you for coming to my GitHub page!
